# My Three.js Project

This project is a simple Three.js application that demonstrates the basics of creating 3D scenes using WebGL. It includes a rotating 3D cube placed within a scene. The project showcases the following concepts:

- **Scene Setup**: Creating a Three.js scene and camera to render 3D objects.
- **Rendering**: Using a WebGLRenderer to display the scene on a webpage.
- **3D Object Creation**: Basic geometric shapes, like a cube, are created and added to the scene.
- **Animations**: A basic animation loop to continuously rotate the 3D object and render it.

This repository is an excellent starting point for those learning Three.js and WebGL. It can be expanded by adding more complex 3D objects, textures, lights, or even interactivity.

## Features

- Simple 3D cube rotating in the scene.
- Basic Three.js setup, including camera, renderer, and animation loop.
- Responsive canvas resizing on window resize.

## Technologies Used

- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser.
- **HTML5**: Structure of the webpage and integration with JavaScript.
- **CSS3**: Styling for the canvas and the page.

## Getting Started

To get a local copy of the project up and running, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/my-threejs-project.git
    ```
   
2. Open the `index.html` file in your browser.

    - For a more advanced setup, you can use a local server (e.g., with Node.js or Python).
   
3. Open the project in a modern browser (preferably one that supports WebGL like Chrome or Firefox).

4. Start experimenting! Modify the `app.js` to change the 3D object, camera angles, or add new objects.
